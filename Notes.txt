Serial:

As send and recv are both blocking, a serial implementation requires us to convert send and recv to the nonblocking versions. This makes the serial version more inefficient as the CPU might be busy looping when the message actually arrives

Threaded:

Have at least one thread manage recv from both client and destination side.
