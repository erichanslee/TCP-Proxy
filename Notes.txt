Serial:

As send and recv are both blocking, a serial implementation requires us to convert send and recv to the nonblocking versions (or deal with some other workaround). 

The naive way would be to use fcntl to change the socket file descriptors to nonblocking. However, this is an inefficient implementation as our CPU will most likely be looping while a message arrives. 
The better way would be to use select

Threaded:

Have at least one thread manage recv from both client and destination side.
